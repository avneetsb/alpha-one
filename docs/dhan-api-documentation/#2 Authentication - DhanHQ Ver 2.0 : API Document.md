# Authentication

DhanHQ APIs require authentication based on an access token which needs to be passed with every request. There are various different methods to generate this access token depending on user type and the purpose of usage.

There are two categories in which users of DhanHQ APIs are divided:

- Individual - Users who have Dhan account and are coders, traders, geeks who want to build their own algorithm or trading system on top of DhanHQ APIs

- Partners - Platforms who want to build on top of DhanHQ APIs and serve it to their users. This can be algo platforms, fintechs, banks, PMS, and others.


## Eligibility

All Dhan users get access to Trading APIs for free. This means you can place and manage orders, positions, funds and all other transactions without paying any extra charges. For Data APIs, there are additional charges which are mentioned on the platform.

If you are a partner who wants to get integrated and build on top of DhanHQ APIs, you can reach out to us by filling form on the DhanHQ website [here](https://dhanhq.co/trading-apis). We are looking forward to build the ecosystem around DhanHQ APIs.

## Getting Started

### For Individual Traders

As an individual trader, there are two methods using which a user can generate an access token:

- Directly generate access token from Dhan Web
- Use API key based authentication method


#### Access Token

Individual traders can directly get their Access Token from [web.dhan.co](https://web.dhan.co/). All Dhan users are eligible to get free access to Trading APIs. Here's how to get your Access Token:

- Login to [web.dhan.co](https://web.dhan.co/)

- Click on My Profile and navigate to **_'Access DhanHQ APIs'_**

- Generate "Access Token" for a validity of 24 hours from there.

- User have an option to enter Postback URL while generating the access token, to get order updates as [Postback](https://dhanhq.co/postback/).


Refresh Access Token

You can refresh your token for 24 hours with this endpoint:

```
curl --location 'https://api.dhan.co/v2/RenewToken' \
--header 'access-token: {JWT Token}' \
--header 'dhanClientId: {Client ID}'
```

This expires your current token and provides you with a new token with another 24 hours of validity. You can use this only for tokens generated from Dhan Web.

#### API key & secret

Individuals can login with an OAuth based flow as well. All dhan users can generate individual user specific API key and secret. To generate API key and secret, a user needs to follow the below steps:

- Login to [web.dhan.co](https://web.dhan.co/)

- Click on My Profile and navigate to **_'Access DhanHQ APIs'_**

- Toggle to **_'API key'_** and enter your app name

- Enter **App name**, **Redirect URL** (to be used at the end of Step 2 provided below) and **Postback URL** (which is option to get updates on [Postback](https://dhanhq.co/postback/)).


Note

API Key & Secret are valid for 12 months from the date of generation

After getting the API key and secret, user needs to follow below three steps, in order to generate access token, which can be used for all other API authentication.

**STEP 1 : Generate Consent**

This API is provided to generate consent to initiate a login session. On this step, the App ID and secret is validated and a new session is created for the user to enter credentials.

```
curl --location --request POST 'https://auth.dhan.co/app/generate-consent?client_id={dhanClientId}' \
--header 'app_id: {API key}' \
--header 'app_secret: {API secret}'
```

The response of this flow will have `consentAppId`. This `consentAppId` will be required for the next step of browser based flow.

Note

User can generate upto 25 `consentAppId` in a day. Each consent app ID stay active until tokenId is generated for them. However, at any given point of time, only one token will be generated.

**Header**

| Field | Description |
| --- | --- |
| app\_id <br>_required_ | API Key generated from Dhan |
| app\_secret<br>_required_ | API Secret generated from Dhan |

**Response Structure**

```
{
    "consentAppId": "940b0ca1-3ff4-4476-b46e-03a3ce7dc55d",
    "consentAppStatus": "GENERATED",
    "status": "success"
}
```

**Parameters**

| Field | Description |
| --- | --- |
| consentAppId | Temporary session ID, to be used in step 2 |
| consentAppStatus | Status of the API request |

**STEP 2 : Browser based login**

This endpoint needs to be opened directly on a browser. On this step, the user needs to enter their Dhan credentials, validate with 2FA like OTP/pin/password. If the login is successful, the user is redirected to the URL provided while generating the API key. Along with the redirect, we also send `tokenId` which needs to be used in step 3.

Note

This will end up with a 302 redirect on the browser. You can consume the `tokenId` from the path parameter directly.

**Request URL**

```
https://auth.dhan.co/login/consentApp-login?consentAppId={consentAppId}
```

**Path Parameter**

| Field | Description |
| --- | --- |

**Response Structure**

```
{redirect_URL}/?tokenId={Token ID for user}
```

**Parameters**

| Field | Description |
| --- | --- |
| tokenId | Token ID to be used to generate Access Token |

**STEP 3 : Consume Consent**

This API is to generate access token by validating API key & secret and using `tokenId` generated in the above step. This results in the `access token` which needs to be used in all other API endpoints.

```
curl --location 'https://auth.dhan.co/app/consumeApp-consent?tokenId={Token ID}' \
--header 'app_id: {API Key}' \
--header 'app_secret: {API Secret}'
```

### For Partners

Once partner receives `partner_id` & `partner_secret`. they can use this authentication mechanism for their users.

This login method is a three step based, which is outlined below. This is for all different types of platforms, wherein the user can login to their Dhan account right from the third party platform itself.

**STEP 1 : Generate Consent**

This API is to generate consent to initiate a login session for a user. This is to validate the partner and allow them to start the authentication process.

```
curl --location 'https://auth.dhan.co/partner/generate-consent' \
--header 'partner_id: {Partner ID}' \
--header 'partner_secret: {Partner Secret}'
```

The response of this flow will have `consentId`. This `consentId` can be used for the next browser based flow.

## Setup Static IP

Static IP whitelisting is mandatory as per the new SEBI and exchange guidelines. In line with this, you can use the below APIs to set Static IP for your account. Alternatively, you can also use Dhan Web ( [web.dhan.co](https://web.dhan.co/)) to setup your Static IP.

You can set up a primary and a secondary IP for your account. Do note that each individual needs to have a unique static IP. Once an IP is whitelisted, it cannot be edited for the next 7 days or as recommended by the exchange.
Do note that Static IP is only required while using Order Placement APIs including Orders, Super Order, Forever Order. While fetching order details or trade details, no such IP whitelisting is required.

Below set of APIs can be used to manage Static IP for your account.

Info

A static IP is a fixed, permanent internet address for your device or server. Unlike the default IP you get on home Wi-Fi (which your ISP changes automatically from time to time), a static IP never changes. To use one, you need to request and purchase it separately from your Internet Service Provider (ISP).

### Set IP

You can use this API to setup Primary and Secondary IP for your account. This supports both IPv4 and IPv6 formats while setting up.

Once an IP is setup, you cannot modify the same for the next 7 days.

```
curl --request POST \
--url https://api.dhan.co/v2/ip/setIP \
--header 'Accept: application/json' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--header 'access-token: {Access Token}' \
--data '{
"dhanClientId": "1000000001",
"ip": "10.200.10.10",
"ipFlag": "PRIMARY"
}'
```

## Setup TOTP

As an API user, you can setup TOTP to simplify authentication for API-only flows, as an alternative to enter OTP received on email or mobile number.

### What is TOTP?

Time-based One-Time Password (TOTP) is a 6-digit code generated from a shared secret and current time (RFC 6238). Once you enable TOTP for your account, you’ll receive a secret (via QR/code) that your server can use to generate a fresh code every 30 seconds.

### How to set up TOTP

1. Go to Dhan Web > DhanHQ Trading APIs section
2. Select Setup TOTP
3. Confirm with OTP on mobile/email
4. Scan the QR via an Authenticator app or enter the code shown into the Authenticator
5. Confirm by entering the first TOTP

Once this is is setup, you will by default see TOTP as an option while logging into any partner platforms or inside the API key based authentication mode.

## User Profile

User Profile API can be used to check validity of access token and account setup. It is a simple GET request and can be a great test API for you to start integration.

```
curl --location 'https://api.dhan.co/v2/profile' \
--header 'access-token: {JWT}'
```

**Response Structure**

```
{
    "dhanClientId": "1100003626",
