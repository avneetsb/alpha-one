# Super Order

Super orders are built for smart execution of your trades. They are a collection of orders clubbed into single order request, which includes entry leg, target leg and stop loss leg along with the option to add trailing stop loss.

This particular set of APIs can be used to create, modify and cancel super orders. You can place super orders across all exchanges and segments.

| --- | --- | --- |
| POST | /super/orders | Create a new super order |
| PUT | /super/orders/{order-id} | Modify a pending super order |
| DELETE | /super/orders/{order-id}/{order-leg} | Cancel a pending super order leg |
| GET | /super/orders | Retrieve the list of all super orders |

## Place Super Order

The super order request API lets you place new super orders. You can place a combination of orders using this API, wether that be entry leg, target leg and stop loss leg.

This order type is available across segments and exchanges. You can place intraday, carry forward or even MTF orders via this order type.
